# softerOcclusion
This is a photoshop action which takes the existing Ambient Occlusion render and makes it softer.

It is an non-destructive action: rather than deleting the original occlusion layer, the layer is hidden.

It creates a soft blend on the occlusion layer using a combination of the multiply and overlay layer types.

Your layer must be named "Ambient Occlusion".
